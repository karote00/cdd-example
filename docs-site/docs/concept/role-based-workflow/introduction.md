In a Context-Driven Development (CDD) architecture, collaboration between different roles is not only encouraged — it's built into the system itself. Rather than working in silos, PMs, designers, developers, and even AI agents contribute contextually through shared protocols and predictable interactions.

This section introduces how each role fits into the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed without breaking modularity. The goal is to empower contributors to collaborate asynchronously while preserving codebase clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

Explore the following pages to see how each role participates:

[How Product Managers interact with the system](./how-product-managers-interact-with-the-system.md)  
[How Designers contribute to UI and flows](./how-designers-contribute-to-ui-and-flows.md)  
[How Developers collaborate across repos](./how-developers-collaborate-across-repos.md)  
[How Testers validate functionality (Coming Soon)](./how-testers-validate-functionality.md)  
[How AI Agents integrate and assist](./how-ai-agents-integrate-and-assist.md)

Each role contributes through context, not control. That’s the heart of CDD.
