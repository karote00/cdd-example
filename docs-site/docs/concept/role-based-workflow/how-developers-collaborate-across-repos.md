# How Developers Collaborate Across Repos

In a CDD system, developers aren't just building code — they are wiring up communication between modules, roles, and systems. Instead of focusing solely on isolated feature implementation, developers contribute to a context-aware architecture that enables modularity, reusability, and asynchronous collaboration.

## Role Overview

- Build modular, context-driven components.
- Define clear contracts for interaction between systems.
- Ensure observability and traceability of system behavior.

## Developers in the CDD Workflow

In CDD, developers build more than features — they construct reliable communication patterns. Every component, service, or tool they write fits into a broader, event-driven system. Developers collaborate with PMs, designers, and even AI agents through predictable contexts and shared protocols.

Key developer responsibilities include:

- Creating modular components that respond to context changes.
- Using observables (like RxJS or similar patterns) to define event-driven data flows.
- Designing and maintaining shared interfaces for cross-repo communication.
- Writing utilities that help other roles (PMs, designers, AI) interact with the system effectively.

## Benefits for Developers

- Clear separation of concerns — logic is decoupled from UI and storage.
- Easier testing and validation via predictable data flow.
- Better maintainability through isolated responsibilities.
- Ability to onboard others (or AI agents) into the workflow with minimal assumptions.
