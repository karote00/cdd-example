# How Testers Validate Functionality

In a CDD system, testing isn't just a phase — it's integrated into the communication protocols that govern how the system behaves. Testers participate by validating not only outcomes but also the contexts that lead to those outcomes.

## Role Overview

- Validate expected behavior through observable state changes.
- Define and automate test cases based on communication patterns.
- Detect regressions by monitoring event flows and context mutations.

## Testers in the CDD Workflow

CDD enables testers to focus on **why** something happens, not just **what** happens. Since the system is built around context propagation and event triggers, testers can inspect and verify how different roles and modules interact across boundaries.

Key tester contributions include:

- Writing test cases that simulate real-world context flows.
- Observing event logs or system snapshots to identify inconsistent behavior.
- Collaborating with developers to define testable interfaces and feedback loops.
- Creating mock contexts to reproduce edge cases and failure scenarios.

## Benefits for Testers

- Better visibility into how the system reacts under different scenarios.
- Easier automation via shared event structures and protocols.
- Closer alignment with PMs and developers through context-aware test plans.
- The ability to test early — even before UI or backend is complete — using mock protocols.

> Testing in CDD is about validating communication, not just final output.
