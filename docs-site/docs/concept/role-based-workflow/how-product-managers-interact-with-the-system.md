# How Product Managers Interact with the System

Product Managers (PMs) play a critical role in defining the high-level goals and outcomes for the product. In a CDD environment, PMs actively shape the system by interacting with its event flows, feedback loops, and prototype behaviors.

## Role Overview

- Translate business needs into clear, actionable goals.
- Define and prioritize feature requirements.
- Monitor system behavior and user feedback to guide iterations.

## PMs in the CDD Workflow

In CDD, PMs work closely with designers and developers by specifying the **communication context** in which features should operate. Rather than working solely on documents or static specs, PMs can prototype and validate behavior by observing how the system reacts to events and data changes in real-time.

Key interactions include:

- Creating and refining user stories that map to communication triggers.
- Using dashboards or tools that visualize communication flows and outcomes.
- Collaborating asynchronously with other roles through shared communication logs.

Additionally, when PMs have new ideas, they can leverage AI within the CDD framework to rapidly generate proofs of concept (PoCs). This enables quick validation and iteration of concepts before committing significant development resources.
