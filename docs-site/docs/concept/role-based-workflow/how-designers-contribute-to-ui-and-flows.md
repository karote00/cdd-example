# How Designers Contribute to UI and Flows

Designers play a crucial role in shaping not only the visual appearance but also the communication flows and interactive behaviors of elements within the system. In a CDD environment, designers focus on defining interaction patterns and user communication flows that guide development of seamless user experiences.

## Role Overview

- Craft UI mockups that align with communication objectives.
- Define communication flows and behaviors for interactive elements.
- Collaborate closely with Product Managers and Developers to maintain consistent context across components.

## Designers in the CDD Workflow

Within CDD, designers serve as the bridge between user needs and system interactions by specifying the communication context in which UI elements operate. They create and refine prototypes that demonstrate how information flows and how users engage with the system.

Key contributions include:

- Designing communication patterns that ensure clarity, responsiveness, and usability.
- Utilizing specialized tools to simulate and validate communication flows prior to development.
- Collaborating asynchronously with developers and PMs through shared communication logs to iterate on UI designs and element behaviors.
