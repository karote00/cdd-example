title: Myths & Misunderstandings about CDD
---

Despite its benefits, CDD often faces common misconceptions. Let’s clarify a few:

---

### # Is CDD just another Event-Driven Architecture?

**No.** While both use events, CDD focuses on **semantic communication contracts** at the module/context level, not just infrastructure messaging.

---

### # Does CDD mean no structure or planning?

**Absolutely not.** CDD requires upfront design of message contracts and module boundaries. It’s deliberate communication design, not chaos.

---

### # Is CDD only for microservices or distributed systems?

**Not at all.** CDD works well in monoliths, frontend apps, or any modular system where communication matters.

---

### # Does CDD replace domain modeling?

**No.** It complements domain modeling by focusing on **how** parts communicate, not **what** the domain means.

---

### # Is CDD too complex or abstract to implement?

**Nope.** Start small with simple observable events and clear message schemas. It’s incrementally adoptable.

---

### # Does CDD mean no centralized control or coordination?

**No.** CDD promotes loose coupling but still allows control and coordination via communication contracts when needed.

---

### Summary

CDD’s power lies in disciplined communication design.  
It’s not “events everywhere” or “no design,” but a clear contract-driven architecture.
